Infants with serious congenital heart disease (CHD) are clinically vulnerable.  Our aims were to explore whether health service changes with the Covid-19 pandemic were associated with poorer outcomes in this population, and whether social characteristics were associated with the study outcomes during pandemic restrictions.
